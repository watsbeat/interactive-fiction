# Description of App
## Purpose
'Explode Learning with Interactive Fiction' is a terminal app designed to enhance the learning engagement of lower secondary students and improve their literacy and numeracy skills. 


## Functionality
The termial app operates as an interactive story where the user inputs answers to challenges as well decisions on how they progress through the game.  

## Challenges 
The challenges are designed to enhance students literacy and numeracy skills. In the current iteration these challenges are mini study games that include hangman, spelling mistakes identification and a calculation problem. 


## Instructions for use
To use the Interactive Fiction Terminal App, the user is directed through mulitple decisons and challenges in order to achieve the end goal in the story. With each new story element in the app, the user is given clear instructions on how to complete the step. For example, in the numeracy challenge, the user must input which type of math problem they would like by entering a number from 1-4. Once the user has selected the problem type they are presented with an problem. The user enters their answer and if correct will progress along the story to the WIN outcome. If they answered incorrectly they will give be provided another opportunity with a hint to give the right answer. If they answer incorrectly again, they are then provide the LOSE outcome , which is death.

## Future Developments
The structure of Interactive fiction allows for numerous future developments. 
The app has the potential for content to be differentiated for each student through saved data and increased difficulty. Content can also be changed to suit other topics. More types of mini games can be provided as challenges. Tracking of the students progress to provide measureable outcomes for teacher/parent review. Further accesibility options can also be implemented through text to speech ability to help with the pronounciation of words, as well as provide access to vision impaired students or those with lower literacy skills.
